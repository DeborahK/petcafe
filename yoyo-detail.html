      <h2>My Story</h2>
      <p>I was adopted from a shelter and was so happy to find a
        home here at the cafe.</p>
      <p>My brother Vanny is also here, but we don't get along.</p>
      <p>I am exceptionally smart.
        If I want to leave the cafe and go to my home upstairs,
        I walk past the video doorbell until it makes a funny noise.
        Then I wait until one of my humans opens the door for me.
        I've trained them well.</p>
        <p>If I'm <em>lonely</em>, I meow loudly.
        When <span>I'm hungry</span>, I stand by my bowl.</p>
